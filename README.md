# HospitalSQL
A Hospital Management Database SQL group term project for my CSC 675 Database course. The database was created with a relationship schema that was based off of various constraints and the resulting ER Diagram. The table was created on the entities of Hospital, Doctor, Patient, and Medical Record. We create a logic schema using MySQL workbench and insert data into our table. Later, we test if we can properly query data from the database through integration of our database on our website and using PHP to query data.
